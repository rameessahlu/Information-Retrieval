Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwellsAnd announced that I'm "articulate"Which means that when it comes to enunciation and dictionI don't even think of it‘Cause I’m "articulate"So when my professor asks a questionAnd my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestionThere’s no misdirected intentionPay attention‘Cause I’m “articulate”So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”My “articulate” answer never goes amissI say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”And when I’m on the block I switch it up just because I canSo when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”And sometimes in classI might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”Yes, I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equalsBecause I’m “articulate”But who controls articulation?Because the English language is a multifaceted orationSubject to indefinite transformationNow you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken EnglishBut I’m here to tell you that even “articulate” Americans sound foolish to the BritishSo when my Professor comes on the block and says, “Hello”I stop him and say “Noooo …You’re being inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not coolBut I’m here to tell you that even our language has rulesSo when Mommy mocks me and says “ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store”I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the lawNever does the word "madd" go  before a present participleThat’s simply the principle of this English”If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop,From every suburbia, and every hood‘Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the GenesisOf this world saying “it is good"So I may not always come before you with excellency of speechBut do not judge me by my language and assumeThat I’m too ignorant to teach‘Cause I speak three tonguesOne for each:Home, school and friendsI’m a tri-lingual oratorSometimes I’m consistent with my language nowThen switch it up so I don’t bore laterSometimes I fight back two tonguesWhile I use the other one in the classroomAnd when I mistakenly mix them upI feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroomI know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolenBut you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is brokenThese words are spokenBy someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this seasonAnd the reason I speak a composite version of your languageIs because mines was raped away along with my historyI speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind usThat our current state is not a mysteryI’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people madSo unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair badI’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparitySo don’t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charityAs much as has been raped away from our peopleHow can you expect me to treat their imprint on your languageAs anything less than equalLet there be no confusionLet there be no hesitationThis is not a promotion of ignoranceThis is a linguistic celebrationThat’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job applicationI can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to knowAnd when they call me for the interview I’ll be more than happy to show thatI can say:“What’s good”“Whatagwan”And of course …“Hello”Because I’m “articulate”Thank you.(Applause)
