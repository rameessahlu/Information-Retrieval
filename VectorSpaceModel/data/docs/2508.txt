Mother Earth: Our end was imminent yet finality relented. Wind, water and fire gently revived; you and I reconciled, rhythms realigned, the blues gone green. Your care in conserving in exchange for my fruit and replenishing this picturous restoring of painted skies, mountains rolling, forest covering — no more warming. The purity and simplicity of how we used to be.You remember me? All I give to humanity? Housing, land, seas, birds, beast and all of mankind, exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet and vibrate harmoniously.(Piano plays)(Violin plays)(Music)(Music tempo quickens)(Violin plays)(Music)(Violin plays)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)My beauty altered, muddied waters, fields stripped bare, interior scarred beyond repair, our memories eroding. You once obsessed over my frame and how I came to be; my nature, its polarity — how my sweet winds whisper softly, yet assault seas.You remember me? All I give to humanity? Housing, land, seas, birds, beast and all of mankind — exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet and vibrate harmoniously.The unseen traveler forever passing, carrying life, moving, awning of earth felt and heard, strong and stirring, blowing. Breathe you in, cleansing wind, gentle and still, quieter. The source eternally here, ascent and descending: air.Rhythmic flow, fluid and graceful, waves of serenity, smooth strings of purity, rains replenishing rapidly, rivers of dreams, raging springs covering earth in abundance, universal solvent dissolving, drink, liquid, life and power: water.Born when the universe was formed, warmed mankind, gave him light, colored rays illuminate ember flickers incandescent, powerful and brilliant. Sacred son of air, father of fury, heat dancing vigorously between perfection and beauty. Unconfined agility, fast and fancy, sparks of ingenuity rise: fire.(Canku One Star dances)(Choir chants)(Drums)(Drumming and chanting)(Drumming and chanting)(Drumming and chanting)(Music ends)(Applause)(Violin plays)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)
