Picture this: It's Monday morning, you're at the office, you're settling in for the day at work, and this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall, walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair. Doesn't say a word — just rolls away with it. Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs  that are out there. Doesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair to get some work done today. You wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink. You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say, "Why my chair?"Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office, and a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar. (Laughter) And it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall, and the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about. But there's no agenda. There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting. And yet you accept the  meeting invitation, and you go. And when this highly  unproductive session is over, you go back to your desk, and you stand at your  desk and you say, "Boy, I wish I had those two hours back, like I wish I had my chair back." (Laughter)Every day, we allow our coworkers, who are otherwise very,  very nice people, to steal from us. And I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture. I'm talking about time. Your time. In fact, I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS: Mindless Accept Syndrome. (Laughter) The primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar. (Laughter) It's an involuntary reflex — ding,  click, bing — it's in your calendar, "Gotta go, I'm already late  for a meeting." (Laughter)Meetings are important, right? And collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise. And a well-run meeting can yield  really positive, actionable results. But between globalization and pervasive information technology, the way that we work has really changed dramatically  over the last few years. And we're miserable. (Laughter) And we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting, it's because of MAS, our  Mindless Accept Syndrome, which is a self-inflicted wound.Actually, I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic. Let me tell you why. A couple of years ago, I put a video  on Youtube, and in the video, I acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on. It goes on for about five minutes, and it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings. There's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting. There are the participants who  have no idea why they're there. The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck. And everybody leaves very angry. It's kind of funny. (Laughter) Let's take a quick look. (Video) Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal. As a group, we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi, who just joined? Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today. (Laughter) Hi, Joe. Thanks for  joining us today, great. I was just saying, we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through, so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal. As a group, we need to decide if — bloop bloop — (Laughter) Hi, who just joined? No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)Sound familiar? Yeah, it sounds familiar  to me, too. A couple of weeks after I put that online, 500,000 people in dozens of countries, I mean dozens of countries, watched this video. And three years later, it's still getting  thousands of views every month. It's close to about a million right now. And in fact, some of the biggest companies in the world, companies that you've  heard of but I won't name, have asked for my permission to use  this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company. And if the numbers — there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies — aren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings, there are the many, many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up. Thousands of people wrote things like, "OMG, that was my day today!" "That was my day every day!" "This is my life." One guy wrote, "It's funny because it's true. Eerily, sadly, depressingly true. It made me laugh until I cried. And cried. And I cried some more." (Laughter) This poor guy said, "My daily life until  retirement or death, sigh." These are real quotes and it's real sad.A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief  that we are powerless to do anything other  than go to meetings and suffer through these  poorly run meetings and live to meet another day. But the truth is, we're  not powerless at all. In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands. It's right at our fingertips, literally. It's something that I call ¡No MAS! (Laughter) Which, if I remember my  high school Spanish, means something like,  "Enough already, make it stop!"Here's how No MAS  works. It's very simple. First of all, the next time you  get a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all, click the tentative button! It's okay, you're allowed,  that's why it's there. It's right next to the accept button. Or the maybe button, or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately. Then, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting. Tell them you're very excited  to support their work, ask them what the goal  of the meeting is, and tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal. And if we do this often enough, and we do it respectfully, people might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. And you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it. People might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine! Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. People just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours. And they just might bring your chair back, too. (Laughter) No MAS! Thank you. (Applause).
