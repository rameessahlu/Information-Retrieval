Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.William Kamkwamba: Thanks.CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?WK: This is my home. This is where I live.CA: Where? What country?WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?WK: I wanted to make a windmill.CA: A windmill?WK: Yeah.CA: What, to power — for lighting and stuff?WK: Yeah.CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library, and I read a book that would — "Using Energy," and I get information about doing the mill. And I tried, and I made it.(Applause)CA: So you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book.WK: Ah, no. I just —CA: What happened?WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four — ah — three blades, and mine has got four blades.CA: The book had three, yours had four.WK: Yeah.CA: And you made it out of what?WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.CA: OK.WK: Yeah.CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?WK: Yeah. I test.CA: And what did you make the windmill out of? What materials did you use?WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls —CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?WK: Yeah. The windmill.CA: And so, and that windmill, what — it worked?WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.CA: How much electricity?WK: 12 watts.CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?WK: Four bulbs and two radios.CA: Wow.WK: Yeah.(Applause) CA: Next slide — so who's that?WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.CA: So what did they make of — that you were 14, 15 at the time — what did they make of this? They were impressed?WK: Yeah.CA: And so what's your — what are you going to do with this?WK: Um —CA: What do you — I mean — do you want to build another one?WK: Yeah, I want to build another one — to pump water and irrigation for crops.CA: So this one would have to be bigger?WK: Yeah.CA: How big?WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?WK: Yeah.CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream?WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.CA: And as you think of your life going forward, you're 19 now, do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for coming.WK: Thank you.(Applause)
