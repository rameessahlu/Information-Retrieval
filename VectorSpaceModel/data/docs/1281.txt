(Music)(Applause)(Applause)(Music)(Applause)(Music)(Applause)Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing. That's amazing.

And then I — That was the first thing I learned, and then I started progressing to other things. And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be —(Laughter) (Applause)CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

Do you have anything else?PR: We haven't prepared anything.CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.

And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.(Applause)(Laughter)(Music)(Applause)
