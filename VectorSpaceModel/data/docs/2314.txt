(Music)I went down to St. James InfirmaryTo see my baby thereShe was lying on a long wooden tableSo cold, so still, so fairI went up to see the doctor"She's very low," he saidI went back to see my babyGood God she's lying there deadI went down to old Joe's bar roomOn the corner of the squareThey were serving drinks as per usualAnd the usual crowd was thereTo my left stood Old Joe McKennedyHis eyes were bloodshot redHe turned to the crowd around himAnd these are the words he said"Let her go, let her go, God bless herWherever she may beShe can search this whole wide world all overBut she'll never find another man like meShe can search this whole wide world all overAnd she'll never find another man like meWhen I die, please God, bury meIn my ten-dollar Stetson hatPut a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chainSo my friends know I died standing patGet six gamblers to carry my coffinAnd six choir girls to sing me a songStick a jazz band on my hearse wagonTo raise hell as I go alongNow that's the end of my storyLet's have another round of boozeAnd if anyone should ask youJust tell them I got the St. James Infirmary blues(Applause)
