(Music) Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that: life without the possibility of parole. For us lifers, as we call ourselves, our only chance for release is through commutation, which has only been granted to two women since 1989, close to 30 years ago. Our song, "This Is Not Our Home," it tells of our experiences while doing life without the possibility of parole.(Music)Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.I'm a grandmother.I'm a daughter.I have a son.I'm not an angel.I'm not the devil.I came to jailwhen I was so young.I spend my time hereinside these prison walls.Lost friends to death,saw some go home.Watch years pass,people come and go,while I do life without parole.I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.I'm doing time here.This is not my home.Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.Will I seemy familyor die alone?As the years go by,I hold back my tears,because if I cry I'd give in to fear.I must be strong, have to hold on.Gotta get throughanother year.I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.I'm doing time here. This is not my home.Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.Will I seemy familyor die alone?I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.All I'm asking is for forgiveness.Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.Is there a place for mein the world out there?Will they ever know or care that I'm chained?Is there redemption for the sin of my younger days?Because I've changed.Lord knows I've changed.I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done.I'm doing time here. This is not my home.Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.Will I seemy familyor die alone?Will I seemy familyor die alone?I'm known to you as Inmate 008106. Incarcerated 29 years.
