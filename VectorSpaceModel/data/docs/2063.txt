(Guitar music)I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too longThere's something inside this weary headthat wants us to love just insteadBut I was just thinking, merely thinkingI've got loads of pictures,I've got the one of you in that dancing dressBut man I feel silly in that dim lightJust after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights,I am sinking, merely sinkingI think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babeI'm a singer without a songIf I wait for you longermy affection is strongerand I ... I was just thinking, merely thinkingthat this boat is sinkingI'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupidsI'm tired of calling you and missing you and dreaming I slept with youDon't get me wrong I still desperately love youinside this weary headI just want us to love just insteadBut I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinkingI think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babeand time is running me stillIf I wait for you longermy affection is strongerI ... I was just thinkingI ... I was just thinkingthat I'm tired of calling you once a weekthinking of long distance rates instead of kissing youSo baby I'm sinking,merely sinking(Guitar music ends)(Applause)Thank you.Singing is sharing. When you sing, you have to know what you're talking about intimately, and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself. I look for this intention to share in everything, and I ask: what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product or this restaurant or this meal? And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end, then you are taking, not giving.And this is a song that's about — it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of. This song is called "Home," and it's sort of a "This is where I'm from, nice to meet you all," kind of song.(Laughter)(Applause)(Piano music)Home is the sound of birds early in the morningHome is a song I've always rememberedHome is the memory of my first day in schoolHome is the books that I carry aroundHome is an alley in a faraway townHome is the places I’ve been and where I’d like to goHomeI'm always gonna feel at homeNo matter where I may roamI'm always gonna find my way back homeNo matter how far I’m goneI’m always gonna feel this longingNo matter where I might stayHome is a feather twirling in the airHome is flowers in a windowsillHome is all the things she said to meHome is a photo I never threw awayHome is the smile on my face when I dieHome is the taste of an apple pieI met a woman, she always lived in the same placeAnd she said home is where you’re born and raisedAnd I met a man, he sat looking out to the seaAnd he said home is where you want to beI met a girl in some downtown barAnd she said I'll have whatever he's havingAnd I asked her how come we never met before?And she said all my life I’ve been tryingto get a place of my ownI’m always gonna feel at homeNo matter where I may roamAlways gonna find my way back homeNo matter how far I’m goneI'm always gonna feel this longingNo matter where I might stay(Piano music)(Piano music ends)(Applause)
