Graphic design is more than meets the eye.

What is Graphic Design?
Graphic Design definition: effective visual communication of an idea or concept

Most people have a vague idea of what a graphic designer does. Creating logos for businesses? Fixing up images in Photoshop? Making magazine ads? Yes—designers do these things—but they’re only elements of a much bigger picture.

Graphic design is all around you

Look around. Design is everywhere—from your morning cereal box to a music festival poster to the process of ordering an Uber. Merging creativity with strategy, communication with brand savvy and aesthetic with logic, design is just about everywhere you look—and it matters. There are endless opportunities for graphic designers to make their mark.

Graphic design is about communication

Good communication skills are an essential part of the designer’s toolkit. Making pretty pictures is nice, but the most important part of the graphic design process happens before you even put pen to paper. Designers must interpret client needs. At Shillington, we teach how to listen, research, develop concepts and find the balance between aesthetics and function.

Graphic design is all about the basics.

All design is founded in the five graphic design principles: balance for stability and structure, hierarchy to create organization and direction, contrast to generate impact and highlight important areas, repetition to unify and strengthen and alignment to create a sharper, clearer outcome. Learn more about the graphic design fundamentals and how we teach them in our course and approach.
