Data Analytics refers to the set of quantitative and qualitative approaches for deriving valuable insights from data. It involves many processes that include extracting data and categorizing it in order to derive various patterns, relations, connections, and other such valuable insights from it. Today, almost every organization has morphed itself into a data-driven organization, and this means that they are deploying an approach to collect more data that is related to their customers, markets, and business processes. This data is then categorized, stored, and analyzed to make sense out of it and derive valuable insights from it.
