Genetic algorithms are based on the classic view of a chromosome as a string of genes. R.A. Fisher used this view to found mathematical genetics, providing mathematical formula specifying the rate at which particular genes would spread through a population (Fisher, 1958). Key elements of Fisher’s formulation are:

a specified set of alternatives (alleles) for each gene, thereby specifying the allowable strings of genes (the possible chromosomes),
a generation-by-generation view of evolution where, at each stage, a population of individuals produces a set of offspring that constitutes the next generation,
a fitness function that assigns to each string of alleles the number of offspring the individual carrying that chromosome will contribute to the next generation, and
a set of genetic operators, particularly mutation in Fisher’s formulation, that modify the offspring of an individual so that the next generation differs from the current generation.
Natural selection, in this formulation, can be thought of as a procedure for searching through the set of possible individuals, the search space, to find individuals of progressively higher fitness. Even when a natural population consists of a single species – say the current generation of humans – there is considerable variation within that population. These variants constitute samples of the search space.
