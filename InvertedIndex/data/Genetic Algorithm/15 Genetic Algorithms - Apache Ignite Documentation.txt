Genetic Algorithms

Overview
Genetic Algorithm (GA) represents? a subset of Ignite Machine Learning APIs. GA is a method of solving optimization problems by simulating the process of biological evolution. GAs are excellent for searching through large and complex data sets for an optimal solution. Real world applications of GAs include automotive design, computer gaming, robotics, investments, traffic/shipment routing and more.

All genetic operations such as Fitness Calculation, Crossover, and Mutation are modeled as a ComputeTask for distributive behavior. Also, these ComputeTasks leverage Apache Ignite's Affinity Collocation to route ComputeJobs to respective nodes where Chromosomes are stored.

The following diagram depicts the architecture of Genetic Algorithms:

Usage Guide
In order to begin using Genetic Algorithm, follow these steps:

Create a GAConfiguration
Define the Gene and Chromosome
Implement a fitness function
Define terminate condition
Evolve the population
We will use a HelloWorldGAExample to demonstrate.

Our goal will be to derive the phrase: "HELLO WORLD"

Create a GAConfiguration
To begin, we create a GAConfiguration object. This class is utilized to customize the behavior of GA.
