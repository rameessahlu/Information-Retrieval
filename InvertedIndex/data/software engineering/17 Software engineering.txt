Why is there an increased demand for software engineers?
Software engineer and developer job positions dominated Glassdoor's list of the 10 most in-demand tech jobs of 2019. The global demand for engineers is skyrocketing year over year, with demand for blockchain engineers increasing at 517% and security engineers at 132%, according to Hired's 2019 State of Software Engineers report.

The demand for software engineers correlates with the ebbs and flows of new technology. For example, the explosion of blockchain in the past year has resulted in a need for software engineers with blockchain skills, the report found.

Most companies are trying to stay competitive, resulting in a greater investment in technology, across all sectors, according to Glassdoor's Economic Research Blog. As more companies are trying to transform into tech companies, software engineers are needed in those industries (retail, finance, manufacturing, etc.) to plan, manage, and launch the software.

Software engineers and software developers are interconnected, but mutually exclusive. Software developers help maintain existing software performance, recommend improvements, and develop updates or new software programs in code. The key difference is in the word "engineer," because engineers are involved in the development of software, but developers don't necessarily have the engineering background to be involved in that part of the process.

There are many different paths to becoming a software engineer, and most take the one less traveled, according to Hired's previously mentioned 2019 State of Software Engineering report.

While 46% of respondents start their software engineering careers by earning a bachelor's degree in computer science, one in five said they are instead self-taught. Some 13% of respondents said they took a more hybrid approach, taking advantage of developer bootcamps through companies like General Assembly and Hack Reactor, the report found.

In terms of learning top programming languages, sites like GitHub offer plenty of guides and resources to get started.

Coding bootcamps have proven to be extremely beneficial for software engineers: 76% of bootcamp graduates said the courses helped prepare them for their software engineering job. Bootcamps are a great resource for software engineers looking to reskill, upskill, or break into the field, the Hired report added.

For prospective software engineers who want more in-depth knowledge on the topic, EdX offers plenty of courses and degree plans for software engineers. The best part is all courses are online, which could be helpful for working professionals and parents. EdX has introductory courses to software engineering, as well as advanced certificate programs.
