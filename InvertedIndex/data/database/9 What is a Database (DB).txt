Definition - What does Database (DB) mean?
A database (DB), in the most general sense, is an organized collection of data. More specifically, a database is an electronic system that allows data to be easily accessed, manipulated and updated.

In other words, a database is used by an organization as a method of storing, managing and retrieving information. Modern databases are managed using a database management system (DBMS).

Techopedia explains Database (DB)
Software programmers are well acquainted with database concepts through relational databases like Oracle, SQL SERVER and MySQL, etc. Typically, a database structure stores data in a tabular format.

Database architecture may be external, internal or conceptual. The external level specifies the way in which every end-user type comprehends the organization of its corresponding relevant data in the database. The internal level deals with the performance, scalability, cost and other operational matters. The conceptual level perfectly unifies the different external views into a defined and wholly global view. It consists of every end-user required generic data.
