DIGITAL AUDIOVISUAL LECTURES

In 2009, we recorded 200 instructional videos for the topics of a typical course in Numerical Methods at University of South Florida and Arizona State University.  These videos have been annotated, and are also available at the YouTube channel named numericalmethodsguy.  Additions to the video lectures were made in 2010 and 2012 to cover a few more topics (such as Simpson's 1/3 rule, Gauss Seidel Method, Lagrange Interpolation, Fast Fourier Transforms, Partial Differential Equations, and Optimization, etc) that are taught at other universities.   In 2013 alone, we have had 900,000 views of these videos.
