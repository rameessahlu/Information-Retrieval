Numerical Analysis

The direct numerical simulation of many scientific processes remains impractical, even with modern supercomputers.
At CCM, we are developing fast, accurate and robust high-order solvers for many of the equations of classical and modern physics in complicated geometries, with application to fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, acoustics, heat transfer and diffusion, quantum mechanics and plasma physics. We also build efficient software libraries for fundamental tasks in scientific computing and data analysis.

For information about the weekly seminar, see here.
