WELCOME TO NUMERICAL METHODS - PART 1 of 2

Numerical methods are techniques to approximate mathematical procedures (example of a mathematical procedure is an integral).  Approximations are needed because we either cannot solve the procedure analytically (example is the standard normal cumulative  distribution function)

or because the analytical method is intractable (example is solving a set of a thousand simultaneous linear equations for a thousand unknowns for finding forces in a truss). 

 In this Part 1 of a two-part course in numerical methods, you will

Apply the numerical methods for the following mathematical procedures and topics - Differentiation, Nonlinear Equations, and Simultaneous Linear Equations. 
Calculate errors and their relationship to the accuracy of the numerical solutions throughout the course.
WHERE IS PART 2 OF 2 OF THIS COURSE?

The Part 2 of 2 this two-part course in numerical methods will be at https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1189. That course will cover the following mathematical procedures and topics - Interpolation, Regression, Integration and Ordinary Differential Equations.

WHERE TO BEGIN

This is a self-paced course and hence the pace is up to you.  The recommended schedule is two to three modules per week.  It is advisable to start from the beginning. Simply click here on Modules or in the left menu and you are ready to go.  Each module has a textbook chapter, several short digital audiovisual lectures, a multiple-choice test with complete solutions, and then two to three quizzes with 3 questions each for the final assessment.  You can jump to any module without having finished the previous modules.  To get started, please visit the course orientation page.
