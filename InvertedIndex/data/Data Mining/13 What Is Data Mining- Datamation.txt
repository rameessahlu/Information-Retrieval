A popular analogy proclaims that data is "the new oil," so think of data mining as drilling for and refining oil: Data mining is the means by which organizations extract value from their data.

In more practical terms, data mining involves analyzing data to look for patterns, correlations, trends and anomalies that might be significant for a particular business. As such, it is closely related to Big Data, a larger term that encompasses the many uses of data analytics software (for instance, common apps like Zoho Analytics) to understand trends.
