Process digital images with computer algorithms
Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to create, process, communicate, and display digital images. Digital image processing algorithms can be used to:

Convert signals from an image sensor into digital images
Improve clarity, and remove noise and other artifacts
Extract the size, scale, or number of objects in a scene
Prepare images for display or printing
Compress images for communication across a network
The following images illustrate a few of these examples:

Removing noise using a Wiener Filter

Effective techniques for processing digital images include using algorithms and tools that provide a comprehensive environment for data analysis, visualization, and algorithm development.
